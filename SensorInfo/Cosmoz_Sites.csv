Cosmoz_21,Bullawarrie,Cosmoz,Cosmoz,Public,,,-28.80932,148.76512,TRUE,CSIRO,David.Mcjannet@csiro.au,http://cosmoz.csiro.au,This site is located in Queensland’s south-western grain belt near Mungindi and is representative of broad-acre cropping on cracking clays. Soils are formed from alluvium on the Moonie River floodplain. Winter crops (wheat  chickpea) predominate which are dependent on stored soil water for reliable grain yields.  The site is adjacent to two GRDC sponsored cropping studies managed by: the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries; and the Northern Grower Alliance. The soil type is broadly classed as a grey vertosol or cracking clay with a plant available water capacity of ~180mm. The landscape has low relief and experiences occasional flooding.
